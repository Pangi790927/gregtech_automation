Intro
-----

This is the user guide for the OpenComputers Extension module to the AE2 system that we have in
our base. In this manual I will try to explain how to use it, how to debug it and how to configure
it to craft recipes.

Using it
--------

To use the Extension you simply request the desired recipe from any AE2 terminal that is connected
to the main ME Controller, but there is something to keep in mind: the Extension uses some "tokens"
to know what it should craft and there is a limited number of those in the AE2 system at any time,
so the system will not be able to craft more recipes then it has tokens. Those tokens are sticks
labeled with specific names inside the Inscriber Press. The solution to enable the system to craft
more of one recipe is to search for it's Inscriber Name Press tag and craft more tokens at the
Inscriber Press.

Debuging it
-----------

The Extension may have bugs, there are none known at this moment, but you may find yourself in the
situation in which the crafting of some recipe is stuck. If that is the case you may want to
know if the recipe takes a lot of time or if it is really bugged, here are some things to check:

    1. Go in front of the monitor of the Extension and see if there are any errors writen on screen.
    If you find any errors there, the machine is broken in some way.

    2. Read from the screen of the monitor what the Extension is crafting and go find the respective
    machine inside the Extension. If the machine is not doing anything but has items in it,
    something went wrong.

    3. If there is no machine doing anything but there are items in the crafting chest something
    broke.

    4. If there are items and tokens in the ME input chest and the Extension does nothing it means
    that the Extension does not recognize the recipe or it broke.

If the machine blocked for no reason, you can follow the following steps to restart it:
    
    1. Stop the crafting request comming from the ME
    2. Shut down the Extension's computer
    3. Clear all the 9 machines, make sure that they have no items or fluids in them
    4. If not empty, clear the liquid from inside the Large Titanium Fluid Cell inside the crafting
    chest
    5. Clean the crafting chest: remove extra items and make sure the circuits and other things are
    still there
    6. Move back all items from the ME input chest to the ME system
    7. Power on the Extension's PC
    8. type gtnh_ae2ex in the prompt and press enter
    9. now the system is ready to receive new crafting requests

Configuring it
--------------

The configuration part refers only to the addition of new crafting recipes to the Extension. The
Extension must know beforehand how to craft an item and you learn it how to do it by configuring it.

The first step is to find a Cutting Knife and an Iron Ingot. After that you use the knife to create
an Inscribed Name Press for your recipe. The name must be unique in the system and must begin with
"recipe_", furthermore you must use only small letters, digits or '_'. For example you would name a
recipe for circuit boards: recipe_circuit_board.

After creating your Inscribed Name Press you would use it inside an Inscriber Press to name a 
vanila minecraft stick, this will be your token. You must create as many tokens as you want to be
able to craft at the same time in the Extension. After creating your token, you would place the
Inscribed Name Press inside the diamond chest in the Automatic-Stick-Nameinator.

Now with your token (the named stick) you must go to a pattern terminal to set your required items:

         ################################
         ################################
         ###     #     #     ####     ###
         ###  1  #  2  #  3  ####  10 ###
         ###     #     #     ####     ###
         ################################
         ###     #     #     ####     ###
         ###  4  #  5  #  6  ####  11 ###
         ###     #     #     ####     ###
         ################################
         ###     #     #     ####     ###
         ###  7  #  8  #  9  ####  12 ###
         ###     #     #     ####     ###
         ################################
         ################################

You must program your recipe based on the required items and the expected outputs:
    * All the required items for the craft must be included. 
    * The stick token must be placed in the 9th slot.
    * Only the desired outputs should be placed in slots 10, 11, 12.
    * You can't have the same item type twice as an input in two different slots.
    * If the recipe requires liquids you must put cells in their place, if the number can't be exact
    you must place more than needed and the excess liquids will be lost.
    * If the recipe gives more of a liquid than can be stored exactly in cells you put less cells in
    the output and the excess liquids will be sent to the ME liquid storage.
    * If cells are needed to move liquid out of the machine then you must place empty cells in the
    8th slot
    * The empty cells that are needed by the recipe can't be placed in the 8th slot
    * You can't put more items or liquids than can fit in the targeted machine

Now that you have your pattern, you must go and program it in the OpenComputers Extension. The chest
looks like so:

            ###########################
            ###########################
            ###     ###     ###     ###
            ###  1  ###  2  ###  3  ###
            ###     ###     ###     ###
            ###########################
            ###     ###########     ###
            ###  4  ###########  5  ###
            ###     ###########     ###
            ###########################
            ###########     ###########
            ###########  X  ###########
            ###########     ###########
            ###########################
            ###########################

You must place your pattern in slot 1.
The selected machine in slot 2.
The machine config if required must be placed in slot 3, or left empty if no config is required
Liquid cells exactly matching the pattern must be placed in slot 4 for inputs.
Liquid cells exactly matching the pattern must be placed in slot 5 for outputs.

After the chest is configure you must go to the computer and press ENTER once and after the prompt
press Y once. Following that you can take your pattern from the config chest and place it in one
of the interfaces in the Extension crafter.
